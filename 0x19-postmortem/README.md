which led to a downtime for many user localy and globly. It affected nearly 100% of the user in the north of africa and some in the south europe region that are related to this server. The cause of this problem
was some wind started by 12:30 AM caused some malfunctioned power lines.

## Timeline(all CET):

    *around 12:30 AM: the wind has stared

## Root cause and resolution:

In 1:02 AM CET the main sever with no power-backup, stoped functing, and the site was down until it was
fixed 5 hours later.

## Corrective and preventative measures:

A backup plan for such situations for exemple power-back will do the job. also a automaited transmition
between the servers shoold be implanted so that there will be no dowen time for the users exprience.

    *resolve all the current user problems occured during the downtime
    *implant an automated solution for server transavtion such as a load balancer
    *monitoring such events so that a solution can be devoleped before much more time
    *inveting in a power backup will be handful in the futur
